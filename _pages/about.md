I'm Snehal Chaudhari, a software engineer who likes solving problems with creative solutions. I build custom software applications that are fast and easy to use. I have experience with many programming languages and frameworks and always look for new technologies to learn. My focus is on developing scalable, reliable software that delivers a seamless user experience. My experience ranges from developing enterprise-grade web applications to creating mobile apps that delight users. I always try to deliver software that exceed expectations, focusing on creativity, innovation, and performance. My portfolio shows my technical skills and creativity, and I am excited to take on new challenges.

I have a Master of Science in Computer Science from Arizona State University and I was a Software Development Engineer at Avaya. With over two years of full-stack development experience, I have built strong technical, leadership, and management skills. I have worked on various large-scale software releases that requires management skills and knowledge of the latest developments in the field.

I'm also interested about the field of Geospatial Data Analysis and Natural Language Processing. I have worked on various projects to improve my understanding in these areas. Please take a look at my portfolio to explore some of my recent projects, and let's connect to discuss more.
