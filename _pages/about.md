With a focus on creativity, innovation, and performance, I'm dedicated to delivering software solutions that exceed expectations. My portfolio is a showcase of my technical skills and creative flair, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges. 

As a Master of Science student in Computer Science at Arizona State University, Tempe, and a former Software Development Engineer at Avaya, I have gained over two years of full-stack development experience. During this time, I have developed expertise in technical, leadership, and management skills. I have worked on numerous large-scale software releases that required crucial time management skills and knowledge of the latest developments in the field.

I'm also passionate about the field of Data Analysis and Natural Language Processing, and I have worked on various projects in my spare time to master my proficiency in these fields. Please take a look at my portfolio to see some of my recent projects, and let's connect to discuss more. 
<!-- My team and I have developed a voice-based payment system for NPCI, taking advantage of the boom in the online payments market with NLP technology. I have also developed a prototype of a deep learning model for generating realistic models to dive deeper into the field of language processing and analysis.  -->
