                            The given graph shows the correlation between how many dinosaur species had
                            harbivourous/carnivorous diet and gap in between their height of those individual group.

                            In the given visualization, the size of each circle represents the count of dinosaur which
                            had either harbivourous or carnivorous diet.
                            <br>

                            The center of each circle lies with average height of the particular group of dinosaur.

                            harbivourous/carnivorous group for that key.

                            This graph represents, the distribution of each species over different country.

                            Given visualization will categories dinosaur species into 5 groups like sauropod, large
                            theropod, small theropod, euornithopod and armoured dinosaur.
                            <br> <br>Each circle arc represents the number of species of particular group.

                            Each country has its own ring, which will help in understanding the distribution of each
                            species over all these contries.
                            <br> <br>

                            This will help in comparing global and local distribution of each species.

            <ul>
                <li>In current exercise, I have used attributes from current dataset like diet, period, lived_in, length
                    and species.</li>
                <li>For the first visualization,
                    <ul>
                        <li>I have used point and lines as marks. The channels will be length of the line which will
                            represent average height (qauntitative attribute), area of the circle (qauntitative
                            attribute) represent number of dinousaur of that species and color hue wherein of the each
                            circle indicate type of diet(categorical attribute).</li>
                        <li>For interaction, one can hover over the circle to get more details about the particular
                            species, their height and diet. Also use can select different categorical attribute for plot
                            using selection.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>For the second dinosaur rings plot,
                    <ul>
                        <li>I have used line as marks which is the arc of ring. The channel in this plot are length of
                            the arc (quantitative) representing number of species of given type and color hue for the
                            rings (categorical) represent type of species.</li>
                        <li>For interaction, one can hover over the dinousaur image to get more details about the
                            particular species, their count. And a play button will replay the animation on click.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>I have taken inspiration from, radial arc desing such as <a

                <li> I have also referred my code from earlier assigments and from Dr. Bryan's lecture for CSE 494.</li>
