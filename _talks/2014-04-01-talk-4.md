## Contibutions
* Contributed in the development of multiple features of IP Office telephony system wherein specifically worked on call-media management, administration, and system monitoring features for on-premise and subscription models. 
* Contributed significantly to the integration of a standalone telephony app with Microsoft Teams for softphones, and call-control capabilities.
* Responsible for building a cross-platform mobile application using the flutter framework along with core telephony services to improve user engagement, accessibility, and administrative experience. 
* Managed streamlining of real-time diagnostics log-management feature for backup and restore activities within multiple clusters.

These projects allowed me to cater to large-scale problems and apply my skills in designing architecture to establish communication channels within a product ecosystem.
